A hypothesis can be a statement about some parameter $\\theta $ of such distribution, e.g., \"the mean height of a women is 175 cm\".\n","\n","*A simple hypothesis* $H: \\theta = \\theta_0$ states that the value of parameter $\\theta$ is $\\theta_0$ (for some constant $\\theta$). On the other side, *a composite hypothesis* $H': \\theta \\in \\Theta_0$ states that the value of $\\theta$ is in the set $\\Theta_0$.\n","\n","A hypothesis is tested using observed values $X_1,\\dots,X_n$ of a random variable, that is random sample, where the values $X_1,\\dots,X_n$ are pairwise independent, but from the same distribution.\n","\n","Testing a hypothesis consists of finding a suitable function $T = T(X_1,\\dots,X_n)$ called test statistics and a set $R$ of values of the function such that we reject the hypothesis if $T(X_1,\\dots,X_n) \\in R$. Our goal is to reject the hypothesis if it is not valid, but we cannot rule out errors. We would like to minimize probability of errors of the following two types. The probability of type I errors:\n","\n","$$ p_1 = P[\\text{we reject } H \\mid H \\text{ is valid}] $$\n","\n","and of Type II errors\n","\n"," $$ p_2 = P[\\text{we do not reject } H \\mid H \\text{ is not valid}]. $$\n","\n","Instead of minimizing both errors simultaneously, we minimize type II error while the type I error is limited from above by a constant $\\alpha$ (usually 0.05, eventually 0.01 or 0.001). The constant $\\alpha$ is called the significance level of the test.\n","\n","\n","## $\\chi^2$-Test\n","\n","**The \"chi-squared\" test of independence** determines whether there is a relationship between two categorical variables. Do the values of one category variable depend on the values of the other categorical variable?
